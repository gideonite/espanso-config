# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # Right
  - trigger: ";right"
    replace: "→"

  # Left
  - trigger: ";left"
    replace: "←"

  # Up
  - trigger: ";up"
    replace: "↑"

  # Down
  - trigger: ";down"
    replace: "↓"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current without year
  - trigger: ";date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%b.%e"

  # Print the current date with year
  - trigger: ";ddate"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%b. %e, %Y"

  # Print the current date with time
  - trigger: ";time"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%b. %e, %Y %H:%M"

  # Print the current date in a machine-readable-fashion
  - trigger: ";stamp"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"

  # math symbols
  - trigger: ";implies"
    replace: "⟹"
  - trigger: ";cdot"
    replace: "⋅"
  - trigger: ";partial"
    replace: "∂"
  - trigger: ";approx"
